# Data Acqusition

Grab the `users_cleaned.csv`, `anime_cleaned.csv`, and `animelists_cleaned.csv` from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist) and put all of them here.

Make sure to have at least `2.3GB` of free space for it.

After all of the files are downloaded, run `setup_data.py` from previous directory and you will have `preprocessed_anime.csv`, `users_cleaned_1000.csv`, `preprocessed_input_1000.csv`, and `user_anime_rating_matrix.csv` in this directory. 

Feel free to delete the downloaded files afterward.
