# ANIME RECOMMENDER

This recommender is developed using user-based collaborative filtering and SVM classifier. The data is acquired from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist).

The model is trained by using `1000 user` at max, because hardware limitation.  Even if it's only `1000 user`, the preprocessed input's dimension are  somewhere around `390785x3534`, which is very huge considering the fact that the exported CSV size is reaching `Â±5 GB` in total.

The way this recommendation system works is by using cosine similarity to find `k` similar user and decide the top `n` anime based on each similar user scoring. The SVM classifier predict the selected user's disliked animes based on each anime's genre and then remove it from the recommendation list.

2. Run `flask run` in terminal
3. Open the provided localhost url
4. Select user and wait for their result

### CLI
1. Follow instructions in [DATA](./data/README.md) directory
